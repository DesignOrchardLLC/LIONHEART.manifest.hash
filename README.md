This repository defines how artifacts move from experimental state
to verified canon.

It does not contain runtime code.  
It does not execute logic.  
It does not provide operational automation.

It defines structure.

## System Architecture

The operating model is layered:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| Design Orchard LLC | Legal authority & canon declaration |
| DrMarchand’s Laboratory | Runtime execution & validation |
| DrMarchand’s Library | Immutable archival mirror |
| Vault | Cryptographic preservation |

Each layer has a defined boundary.  
No cross-authoring is permitted.

## Promotion Flow

Artifacts progress through explicit states:

Experimental → Validated → Archived → Preserved
