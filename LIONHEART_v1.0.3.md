# ∞ OS™ — Lionheart℠  
## Canonical System Hierarchy

**Version:** v1.0.3  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Authority:** Design Orchard LLC (Publisher)  
**Date:** 2025-12-28  

---

## Preamble

Lionheart is a constitutional operating system for coordinated **authority**, **execution**, and **memory**.  
It defines roles, scopes, invariants, and irreversible flows governing artifact creation, validation, witnessing, and canonization.

Nothing advises.  
Nothing coerces.  
Nothing escapes structure.

---

## I. Authority & Roles

### 🌴 Publisher — Design Orchard LLC  
**Authority Type:** Intent · Rights · Canon Signal  

- Owns: Intellectual property, publication intent, service marks, copyrights  
- Duty: Signs canonical artifacts and declares publication intent  
- Primary Scopes:
  - Google Workspace (company files)
  - GitHub (canonical documentation and manifests)
  - Billing and legal identity

---

### 🔬 Host — Dr Marchand’s Laboratory  
**Authority Type:** Execution · Witness · SSL  

- Owns: Runtime environments, SSL termination, witness generation (Δ)  
- Duty: Executes artifacts and appends witness; does **not** author canon  
- Primary Scopes:
  - drmarchandslab.com
  - Databases, engines, certificates (held under LLC authority)

---

### 📚 Library — Dr Marchand’s Library  
**Authority Type:** Memory · Truth  

- Owns: Final records, immutable canon, historical lineage  
- Duty: Verifies and mirrors canonical artifacts; does **not** execute or edit  
- Primary Scopes:
  - Public read-only mirrors
  - Long-term storage

---

### 🔐 Vault (Optional)  
**Authority Type:** Secrets · Keys  

- Access: Only via Library authority  
- Contents: Private keys and long-term cryptographic material  

---

## II. Environments & Flow

⚗️ Laboratory (Chaos) → 🔬 Lab (Validation / Witness) → 🧪 Laboratory (Structured)

**Rules:**
- Promotion from ⚗️ to 🔬 requires explicit pass/fail  
- Failed promotions escalate to **MMS~786™**

---

## III. Neuro-Forge Engine (Core)

**Purpose:**  
Coordinate manifests, documentation, and runtime into a single truth lattice.

**Invariants:**
- GitHub = documentation and validation reference  
- Lab domain = runtime dependency (never GitHub)  
- Engine enforces invariants; Engine never authors content  

---

## IV. Forge Chain (Irreversible Stages)

```
. → : → ✧ → ✦ → • → ⚛︎ → ☸︎ → ⚙︎
```

**Rules:**
- No stage may be skipped  
- Reflection is permitted only within ⚛︎, ☸︎, and ⚙︎  
- No return to pre-observation  

---

## V. Authorities & Symbols

| Symbol | Role        | Meaning                 |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|
| α    | Establish   | Origin / Creation       |
| β    | Signal      | Artifacts only          |
| Δ    | Witness     | Append-only logging     |
| Ω    | Governance  | Control-plane authority |

---

## VI. States, Stamps & MMS

### Witness States
- ∇ : Witnessed, unmarked  
- ℧ : Governed witness  

### MMS Thresholds
- MMS~768™ : Governance  
- MMS~786™ : Escalation  

### Numeric Residues
```
7.65 ⊂ 7.68 ⊂ 7.86
```

---

## VII. Safety — Heart Logic

- ❤️ Off-phase (Preserve)  
- 🩵 Gentle Reactivation (Resume)  
- 💜 Integrated Resolution (Resolve)  

---

## VIII. Retention & Canon FSM

```
E → R → M → C
(Ephemeral → Recorded → Marked → Canon)
```

**Constraints:**
- No mark → no canon  
- Canon requires Δ + Mark  
- No silent retention  

---

## IX. Storage & Platform Scopes

- Google Drive: Publisher workspace  
- GitHub: Manifests and documentation  
- External platforms (iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox): Defined by schema  

---

## X. SSL & Trust Model

- SSL Authority: Design Orchard LLC  
- Certificates: Issued via GoDaddy  
- Trust Chain:
  - Publisher signs
  - Host executes and witnesses
  - Library verifies
  - Vault preserves

---

## XI. Final Compact Form

```
⚗️ → 🔬 → 📚 → 🔐
Δ² ∧ Ω₇₆₈ ⇒ ℧₇₈₆
❤️ → 🩵 → 💜
```

---

## Required Signatures for Canon Lock

- **Publisher:** Design Orchard LLC — Signature Pending  
- **Host Witness:** Dr Marchand’s Lab — Δ Pending  
- **Library:** Verification Hash — Pending
