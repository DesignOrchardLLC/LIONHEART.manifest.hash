DrMarchand’s ∞ OS™ — Lionheart℠

Canonical System Hierarchy

Version: v1.1.0
Status: 🔐 LOCKED
Owner: Design Orchard LLC
Author: Joseph Kyle Marchand
Date: 2026-02-22

⸻

1. Purpose

Lionheart℠ defines the structural authority model governing:
	•	Canon declaration
	•	Runtime execution
	•	Witness validation
	•	Archival preservation

This document is descriptive only.
It does not execute.
It does not instruct.
It does not automate.

2. Authority Model

2.1 Legal Owner — Design Orchard LLC

Authority Type: Legal Rights

Responsibilities:
	•	Intellectual property ownership
	•	Canon declaration
	•	Trademark control
	•	Publication authority

Scope:
	•	Corporate identity
	•	Repository ownership
	•	Licensing and contracts

⸻

2.2 Execution Layer — DrMarchand’s Laboratory

Authority Type: Runtime & Validation

Responsibilities:
	•	Runtime execution
	•	Artifact validation
	•	Witness generation (Δ)
	•	SSL termination

Constraints:
	•	May not author canon
	•	May not modify canonical declarations

Scope:
	•	drmarchandslab.com
	•	Runtime services and infrastructure

⸻

2.3 Archive Layer — DrMarchand’s Library

Authority Type: Immutable Record

Responsibilities:
	•	Canon verification
	•	Immutable archival storage
	•	Hash confirmation
	•	Historical continuity

Constraints:
	•	Read-only
	•	No execution
	•	No modification authority

⸻

2.4 Vault Layer (Optional)

Authority Type: Cryptographic Custody

Responsibilities:
	•	Private key storage
	•	Long-term cryptographic preservation

Access controlled by Design Orchard LLC.

⸻

3. Promotion Flow

Artifacts move through controlled states:

Experimental → Validated → Archived → Preserved

Rules:
	•	Validation requires explicit pass condition.
	•	Failed validation triggers escalation (MMS~786™).
	•	No silent state transition.
	•	Canon status requires witness (Δ) + version lock.

⸻

4. Engine Invariants — Neuro-Forge Engine™

Purpose:
Coordinate structural alignment across documentation, runtime, and archive layers.

Invariants:
	•	GitHub = documentation and canonical reference
	•	Laboratory domain = runtime execution
	•	Library domain = immutable mirror
	•	Engine enforces invariants
	•	Engine does not author content

⸻

5. Witness Model

Witness states:

∇  = Validated
℧  = Governance-applied validation

Escalation thresholds:

MMS768™  = Governance condition
MMS786™  = Escalation condition

Validation is append-only.
Witness records are immutable.

⸻

6. Canon FSM

E → R → M → C
Ephemeral → Recorded → Marked → Canon

Constraints:
	•	No mark → No canon
	•	Canon requires witness
	•	Version increment required for modification
	•	Hash regeneration required for canon change

⸻

7. Platform Separation

Google Workspace
→ Author workspace

GitHub
→ Canonical manifests

Laboratory Domain
→ Runtime execution

Library Domain
→ Archive and mirror

No cross-authoring permitted across layers.

⸻

8. Trust Chain
	1.	Design Orchard LLC declares canonical intent
	2.	DrMarchand’s Laboratory validates and appends witness
	3.	DrMarchand’s Library verifies hash integrity
	4.	Vault preserves cryptographic material

Certificates issued via GoDaddy under LLC control.
